### Who Am I?

Software Developer. Sports fan. Animation enthusiast.

I like getting things done, by that I mean concrete things something that I can point to when asked what I have been doing all afternoon. I dislike basically anything that gets in the way of that. I work hard and want to be proud of what I produce. 

I've got a really bad memory for names and faces (so please don't be offended if it takes me a while to get your name), but I like to think that I'm easy to talk to and approachable.

I like to have a laugh, and the best way to approach me is with a joke.

I was born in the early 90's so simpsons references or Spice Girls on the Sonos is a great way to get on my good side.

### What do I think my job here is?

- Developing software

...Building things, maintaining and improving coding standards where possible, speccing things to be built being involved in decisions regarding new technologies.

- Mentoring and finding (and keeping) talent

...Trying to come up with and improve our processes for getting new developers up to speed, keeping current developers on track (including myself), and generally ensuring this is a great place for developers (and everyone else) to work

- Strategic stuff

...Being involved in discussions on the direction of the business as a whole and the products we produce.

### What did I do before this?

I'm originally from near Oxford in the UK, and moved over to Jersey after finishing university (degree in Ancient History).

When I got to Jersey no-one would hire me because of the unique employment laws. Eventually, despite not being good enough to work at the Cinema I got a job at HMV. I worked there for 9 months before joining RBC on the graduate rotation programme. Fast forward 4 years and I was an Investment Manager with a chartered wealth management qualification when I realised that I didn't enjoy it and didn't feel I was adding much value to anyone. I joined the coding programme, accepted a job at Calligo and then moved to Infuse with the Tom's.

### What do I like from people?

I like people to be direct, I'm an adult and can take criticism. If I'm not told that everyone thinks I'm an idiot how can I change it?!

I also like people to take ownership of things. Why bother doing anything if your not proud of it. It's easy to take ownership of things when everything is going well, but taking ownership means being the guy sat at your laptop at 11pm on a Friday when its your push that broke everything (and even when its not).

I also like people to be proactive. Think a process needs changing? Change it. Think a feature needs building? Spec it, and build it. Think we should be using a different technology? Research it and convince the rest of us.

Finally I like people to share their knowledge or anything else they are interested in. I prefer it if you could send me a link to an article, book or video rather than trying to summarise it for me though.

### What do I dislike?

In a nutshell my biggest dislike is things that I feel are a waste of time. For more specific examples read on...

Meetings. I really dislike meetings. I appreicate they are a necessary evil sometimes, but most are a waste of time, especially those without a clear objective going in. [Read rework by Jason Fried & DHH for a much better explanation than I could give](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ReWork-Change-Way-Work-Forever-ebook/dp/B003ELY7PG/ref=pd_cp_351_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B003ELY7PG&pd_rd_r=d98f034f-e21c-11e8-84c2-9b8c2383eeea&pd_rd_w=bI67g&pd_rd_wg=heSHV&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_p=0ca7ef78-a9c4-4935-a8ff-59221f1ded3e&pf_rd_r=8M9E2AWY28T560CXHFEZ&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=8M9E2AWY28T560CXHFEZ)

People who don't take feedback on board. Whether that's from me or anyone else, if you ignore people when they try to help, you can expect me to start getting frustrated.

People who don't try and help themselves. Obviously we can't do everything on our own, but you should always try to solve your own problems before asking someone else.

Corporate speak. Are you a blue-sky thinking, out of the box kind of guy? Then GTFO.

### Things to know.

I prefer action to words, I would rather try a few different solutions than sit and discuss potential solutions (which is why I'm a developer and not an airline mechanic I guess).

### What do I struggle with?

I struggle with early mornings but have a wife with a 'normal' job so I tend to be in relatively early. Best not to try and speak to me until at least 10 though (or at least speak slowly).

I am not a natural designer, but am trying very hard to get better!
