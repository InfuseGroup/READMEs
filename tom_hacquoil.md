# Tom Hacquoil

### Who am I?
I'm Tom, I&#39;m an &#39;entrepreneur&#39;, I want to take over the world. Everyone has their &#39;thing&#39; – this is mine.

I love design. I love learning. I have a high appetite for risk.

I am a &quot;learned extrovert&quot;, I used to be a massive introvert and was painfully shy, although I don&#39;t think any of you have known me long enough to believe that!



### What do I think my job here is?
I think my role here is to do the following:

- Set the overall direction and strategy of the company.
- Communicate this direction regularly to you (our team), as well as our prospects, clients, investors (if we ever have them) and so on.
- Find, hire, train and support great people against this overall direction whilst maintaining company culture.
- Raise the capital required to achieve this overall direction (either through sales, efficient use of debt or through fundraising).
- In the short term – &#39;plug all the holes&#39; – i.e. handle all the responsibilities not yet covered by another member of the team.


### What did I do before this?
I was the kid that asked for books for Christmas. Believe it or not, I used to be a programmer (although never a particularly good one) – I obsessively taught myself to build stuff from my very early teenage years. I started out with PHP and did a lot of freelance work on the internet (mainly through a freelance portal called oDesk) and then &#39;graduated&#39; to Ruby on Rails after seeing DHH&#39;s &quot;15 Minute Blog&quot; video at some point in 2006 (I was late to the party).

After freelancing for a few years and saving up a bit of money, I started a business called Infuse Internet. I thought I knew what I was doing (hint: I didn&#39;t) and the business did well for a few years, but whilst I felt like we did a good job at actually delivering for our clients, I made about every commercial mistake in the book and focused exclusively on the business and not at all on the broader market (i.e. lots of micro, not so much macro). Even then, I was very interested in &#39;organisational design&#39; and all the company culture stuff, but somehow hadn&#39;t yet realised the value in finding the right people (or not finding the wrong ones).

The failure of Infuse Internet was a super formative experience for me, but I found the whole process extremely difficult to deal with (in pretty much every way) and the journey has definitely shaped a lot of the way I think today. Following the failure of the business, rather than closing the business down and leaving people out of pocket, I (perhaps naively) chose to take on all of the debt the business had accumulated personally – essentially I was overly optimistic and found it too difficult to accept the situation we were in, so I took too long to let the team go, move clients off our platforms etc and ended up accumulated a lot of payroll / supplier / platform debt. This ended up being a fairly hefty sum -low six-figures sterling, all things told – and I&#39;m still paying for this today (six years later at the time of writing)!

After reality set in, I ended up joining Calligo (a cloud computing company that were a client of Infuse Internet&#39;s) as a reasonably early employee as a member of the senior management team (leading software development initially) and grew that business (and my role within it) considerably over a four-and-a-bit year period, ending up as Chief Digital Officer for the last two years – responsible for software development, marketing, recruitment, culture, and a few other bits. I spent the majority of my last two years at Calligo on a plane, travelling throughout the US, Canada and Europe raising finance and finding companies to buy.

I left Calligo in August 2017 to setup The Infuse Group with Tom &amp; Bill.


### What do I like from people?

- Personal development
- Passion for the space. This being the right journey for you.
- Strong, frequent communication (you cannot overcommunicate with me). I don&#39;t want to micromanage, but need to (somehow) know what we&#39;re doing and where we are at all times.
- Criticism (if you don&#39;t tell me that I&#39;m doing things wrong, I might not realise I&#39;m doing things wrong).
- Design (I appreciate that not everyone is a designer and people have different perspectives on the importance of design, but if you could at least try and &#39;design&#39; something before showing it to me I think we&#39;ll have a better time).
- Proactivity
- Transparency
- Momentum

### What do I dislike?

- Lack of personal development – I want to work with people who have a passion for self improvement. I&#39;m less focused on what you&#39;re getting better at, but you should really be constantly getting better at \_something\_.
- Being late is disrespectful of other people&#39;s time. Obviously things happen and it's not possible to always be perfectly on time, but please make a conscious effort to be where you say you&#39;re going to be.
- Poor Grammar – please at least try to spell things properly. If you aren't good at writing or communicating, try to get better!
- Poor Design / Low attention to detail. If you&#39;ve been given something that's been 'designed', it looks like that for a reason – please don&#39;t disregard that completely and put your own spin on things (or think that that is &#39;close enough&#39;) without good reason.
- "That's not my job" – there are very few circumstances where this is an appropriate response to anything.

### Things to know

- I work pretty much all the time. I&#39;m almost always around on Slack, and may send you messages or emails late at night, early in the morning, etc. Please don&#39;t think I expect an instant response – if we&#39;re outside of working hours feel free to ignore it / set DND and get to it when you&#39;re next at work.
- I am not immune to being told what to do. I genuinely believe the most important part of my job is to empower you to do yours, so if the way I work is making your life more difficult, tell me. I have to interact in some capacity with everyone in our business and everybody works differently – if you tell me how you prefer to work, I promise to try my best to adapt our interactions to fit that.
- I genuinely care about making The Infuse Group / Pinpoint the best place to work for you. I don't just invest in engagement / culture / compensation / environment stuff because I think it&#39;s healthy for our bottom line (although I&#39;m sure it is), I care about it because I hate the idea that people don&#39;t love what they do. I&#39;ve been a disengaged employee – it sucks for everyone. If we aren&#39;t ticking all the boxes for you, I want to know as quickly as possible so we can work together to fix that.

### What do you struggle with?

- Balance between strategy and momentum
- Perspectives
- Patience
- Keeping tabs on people – I need to know what's going on but don&#39;t want to interrupt people&#39;s &#39;flow&#39; / be interpreted as micromanaging.
