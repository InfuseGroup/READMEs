## Who Am I?
I'm an engineer at heart so I love building things and problem solving. I'm a mechanic, a woodsman, and a carpenter as well as a software engineer.

I'm the kind of curious chap that wants to find out the limitations of things. Because of this I've always thought I'd die in an unfortunate ride on lawnmower accident.  I have a ride on lawnmower so this is a distinct possibility.  

On the other hand, the fact that i'm always thinking 'what if?' means that I'm good at finding edge cases when testing software.

I would describe myself as a happy, realistic optimist. What you'll soon learn about me is that I am always making jokes - essentially I only ever try to be as serious as I need to in any given situation. Don't be fooled though - I still take great care in everything I do.

I'm quietly self confident but I like listening and am not afraid to admit i'm wrong or change my mind. I can be a little blunt if poked. I pride myself on being trustworthy, diligent, and reliable.  I have high standards of myself, and I expect the same of others. 

## What do I think my job here is?
In short, to make sure we build something that we're incredibly proud of. More specifically:
- To own the entire development methodology
- To grow technical leaders and nurture the development team as a whole
- To provide technical strategy and design
- To interface with other areas of the business to provide technical solutions to business problems

## What did I do before this?
I studied Chemical Engineering at Cambridge, although really I spent most of my time playing poker at night and sleeping all day (it was great).  

After leaving I worked as a mechanic on the family farm, whilst continuining to play online poker in the evening and on weekends.  

I fell into the programming world when I had a requirement for a piece of poker game selection software, but it didn't exist and so I ended up teaching myself coding in order to write it. I turned the software into a business and ran it for a few years before meeting Hacquoil who got me into web development. 

Tom and I worked together at the old Infuse Internet, before both spending 4 years at Calligo prior to starting the Infuse Group.

## What do I like from people?
In short, that they're great at what they do, and that they're respectful.  Respect is the cornerstone of my moral values, and so if you lose my respect you'll know about it.  Other things include:
- **A brain** The ability to strike a balance between getting on with things themselves, and asking for assistance.  
- **Skillz.** They should be better than me in some respect so I can learn from them.  
- **Passion.** You can be passionate about anything, I dont mind what it is, even if you do just love tiddlywinks.
- **Attention to detail.** I want people to produce things of the same quality as I would have done.

## What do I dislike?
- **Stupid, lazy people.** 
- **Not listening.** It's OK to learn at your own pace, as long as I don't have to tell you the same thing three times over when you ask me to review your pull request.  
- **Whining excessively.** Like oddball from the film 'Kellys Heroes', I don't like negative waves. It is only acceptable to moan to me (about business issues) if you also present a solution.
- **Dark UI design**.  My life goals involve buying a server farm that's capable of executing denial of service attacks on those websites that serve me up invasive modals asking me to subscribe to their shitty newsletter.

## Things to know
I try and manage by having discussions, explaining the why between things, communicaing well, and making reasoned, evidence based decisions.  I do this because I don't ever want to have to tell someone to explcitly do something.

I dont't want to micromanage. I want you to make your own decisions and be good enough at what you do that they're mostly the right ones.

I have two personally attributable quotations:
> "I write perfect code, first time, every time." 
> "I don't care if it's shit, as long as its consistently shit" 

The first is some self satire, that latter describes my preference for reusable components over a million bespoke ones.

## What do you struggle with?
- Not doing things on my own terms. I like making my own decisions.
- Networking. I'm an introvert who can occasionally be extroverted if I really need to, although I have no motivation to be.   
- Things that don't interest me.  If I don't care about something, I can't force myself to do it very well.
