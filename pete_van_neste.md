## Pete Van Neste README

### Who Am I?

I’m an entrepreneurial husband, coffee drinking, cafe-with-a-view frequenting, self-confessed geek (I event installed Cat5 network infrastructure in my bedroom at age 13!). I’m a hunter not a farmer. I prefer the chase of a new customer to the operational delivery, or handling a long drawn-out sales process. My ideal week is about 20% strategy, 40% Marketing, 40% coding (or something else technically challenging).

I have a terrible memory and can quickly suffer from decision fatigue, so being organised helps me to keep my mind free for quality decision making. I rely on tools like Asana, Evernote and Hubspot to keep me sane and pretty much follow my system on autopilot. This also means I spend some time each week reviewing, getting clarity and updating my systems.

I’m an introvert that likes people. That said, I am quite good at getting “on stage” when needed (e.g. for client or supplier meetings). But this means I usually need to spend a couple of hours on my own with my headphones on each day to “recover” if I’m going to be at my best. That’s why you’ll often find that I come in a bit late or leave a bit early. I just need to work on my own for a couple of hours which I often prefer to do at home or from a coffee shop.

## What do I think my job here is?

•	To help us find and grow sustainable, scalable sources of new business leads.
•	To help the product team with aspects of the platform that relate to marketing. 
•	To share skills with other members of the team e.g. developers who are interested in learning more about digital marketing and how it affects their work.

## What did I do before this?

I have always been a geek and spent my teenage years learning HTML and ASP (before .net!), and building websites for local businesses. But then I got into sound engineering and the coding fell by the wayside.

The first proper business I ran was an sound system rental company that I started with one of my lecturers whilst at uni (studying Sound Engineering). At the end of uni I decided I wanted to get into corporate event production rather than band gigs (as corporate is much more profitable), so I got myself bought out and set up Stagetex with the proceeds. 

I ran Stagetex from 2008 until 2016 when I found an exit through a trade sale. Why exit so early? I was increasingly interested in business rather than the operational side that attracted me to the industry in the first place. And I didn’t like the business model (commoditised market, high potential for operational liability (e.g. health and safety),  low labour productivity, low ROCE and low P/E ratio. However, these businesses grew entirely through digital marketing and, after trying and failing to outsource to agencies, I had learned how to do it better myself. During my earn out period I consulted for the company that acquired us and grew their digital marketing to a point where it now generates between £100k and £1mm of new business leads per month. 

Since then I’ve been helping other businesses to grow through digital marketing as well as working on my side project https://www.lumodo.io where I’ve been keeping up my coding skills! 

## What do I like from people?

The most important thing with me is to do what you say you will when you say you will. If you commit to something I expect that you will do it. It’s fine to come back and say “I said I’d do x by y and I don’t think I’m going to make it for these reasons.” I’ll happily help out (really!). But I do like to get an update if it’s going wrong. I don’t chase people and assume everything is good unless I hear otherwise.

If you screw up, own up and be the person who stays behind to fix it. I regularly mess things up. I’m a human. You are too. I don’t mind if mistakes are made or things go wrong. I do mind if they get covered up or we don’t learn form them. Also, if something you have done has caused other team members to work late to fix it, please stay and help fix it too. 

Feel free to ask me questions if you need help. I’d like to help and I often learn things through the process too. But if Google could have answered your question or you could have found the answer yourself in one of our systems (e.g. Dropbox / Asana / Slack etc) I will start to get pretty frustrated. Don’t make me send you a http://lmgtfy.com/ link 🙂 

Bring me solutions. If you have a problem, ideally I’d like you to offer some solutions to the problem rather than asking me to come up with the solution. Even if your solution isn’t great I’d prefer you to have brought an idea to the table.

Take the initiative. If you’re on the team it’s because you have the right character and competence for the role.  I’d rather you take the initiative and make a mistake that you learn from than rely on other team members to make every decision for you. 

If you think I’m wrong or I’m doing something you don’t like tell me. You might be right, I might be right. More often than not, a combination of our thinking will be right. I’d rather have a heated discussion and get to the right answer than not make the best decision. 

## What do I dislike?

Time wasting. Things that I think of as time wasting include: unnecessary meetings, people that don’t need to be in meetings being in meetings, copying everyone into an email that only needed to go to a handful of people, asking people questions that you could have answered yourself with a quick Google Search.

I also think it’s important not to waste time by building systems that are too complex for the stage of company we are at now, but also don’t want to underinvest in systems today and cause more pain later on. It’s a fine balance but one that I keep at the forefront of my thinking. 

Oh and back to “do what you say you will when you say you will”. I have lateness. I just think it’s rude. That’s why you’ll find me 10 minutes early for almost everything. If there’s a meeting at 12:00, don’t be the one that turns up at 12:05. If there are 5 people in the meeting you have just wasted 25 minutes of other people’s time.

Going round in circles without learning the lessons of the past (or applying that learning) is also a frustration for me.

## Things to know

The first thing that comes into my head isn’t always right. So in meetings I’ll often be the last to respond or input, or I might not comment at all. I will often send a message round afterwards once I’ve fully processed the discussion. I’m not disengaged, I just like to think things through. 

Sometimes I come across as negative as I will generally asses “what is the worst possible outcome here”. I’m not being negative though. I’m just making sure we have looked at the worst case and have done what we can to reduce the risk of it happening. I do have quite an appetite for risk, but prefer to make sure we have put in place the right measures to control the risk so far as we reasonably can.

Once I start something I don’t stop until it’s done and often block out other things until I’ve completed the task or project at hand. That’s why you might not get an instant response to an email (although I’ll usually reply within 24 hours). If I’m blocking you, let me know and I’ll get you a response. I never want to hold you up.

## What do I struggle with?

I’m quite binary. I see things as either awesome or terrible and rarely see the middle ground. This means I can be a perfectionist but more recently I’ve started to learn the value of “shipping an 80%er”.

Which makes it strange that I am so terrible at proof reading. I type fast, and often miss mistakes in what I write. And I rarely spot my mistakes when I read my writing back. Ideally anything that goes out publicly that I have written will be checked by someone else. 

Known unknowns take up a disproportionate amount of my mental capacity and can lead to decision fatigue quite quickly as I think through all of the potential risks and solutions (especially when a big part of the unknown is a third party). This thought process can be helpful when working on issues that involve a third party (e.g. contract negotiations, tender writing, M&A, legal issues etc), but if I do get involved in these types of projects my creativity will take a hit whilst I’m working on them.
